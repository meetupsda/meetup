# Meetup

Tired of having endless conversations with your friends about when each of you can meet? Meetup is an app that lets you find the time that suits most of you. 
**You just enter your preferred dates, Meetup does the rest!**

## Demo

You can see a demo of how Meetup works on [Heroku](https://meetup-sda.herokuapp.com/).

### Personal Calendar
The good news is, once you've registered and logged in, Meetup keeps all your info on your account! In the Personal Calendar tab you can browse all your Events - i.e. the dates when you are available for a meeting.

## Technical info
We used Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, Bootstrap, Thymeleaf, and of course good old Java for back-end. We deployed the app to Heroku and connected it to the database using Postgres.
